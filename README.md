Data Analyst case study: e-commerce customer reviews

From the Olist Kaggle Challenge. Solved during the Decision Science module in the [Le Wagon Data Science Bootcamp](https://www.lewagon.com/data-science-course/full-time).

The problem: How can we increase profit margin, knowing that bad reviews cause reputation damage?

The client: Brazilian e-commerce platform Olist

The dataset: 120 MB of data containing 100,000 real orders from customers

The task: Analyze what causes negative reviews and suggest appropriate action, assuming that negative reviews have a measurable "cost" of 40-100 BRL (7-18 USD) per review.

Employed methods:
• Python
• Data analysis with Pandas and SciPy
• Statistical modeling with Statsmodels (Logistic Regression)
• Data visualization with Matplotlib, Seaborn and Plotly
